# Prototype Theme 1 - Battleships

The theme set for the first prototype was to create a game idea with a minimalistic control scheme and sprite animations. The game was supposed to be built within the same technological restrictions that retro games from the Game & Watch era where sprites used are not allowed to be projected on top of the same pixel positions. 

Developed with Unreal Engine 4 over two weeks.
